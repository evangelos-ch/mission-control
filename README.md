# army-knife

A set of utilities for retaining sanity while running ML experiments that utilise models written in JAX.

**_HEAVILY_** inspired by [torchkit](https://github.com/kevinzakka/torchkit) and my main goal when developing it was to essentially replicate it but using all the JAX equivalents.

This is for my own personal use as I'm trying to build a tech stack that allows me to rapidly conduct RL experiments for my doctorate.
